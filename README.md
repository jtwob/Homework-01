# Horiseon - Refactoring Code for Accessibility

## Details: The Code

The state of the web-page's code upon inspection lacked any semantic elements in the html file, and the css file was bloated and repetitive. Renaming all of the major tags in the html file, all divs (where applicable) were changed to:

- A Header tag
- A Nav tag
- A Section tag
- An Aside tag
- A Main tag
- A Footer tag

Additionally, the CSS file contained at least three groups of subsections that were styled identically. For readability and length, these were condensed. The CSS file was also reorganized to separate default tags from custom classes, and to keep every item more or less in the order that they appear on the webpage.
